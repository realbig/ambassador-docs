## Access the Settings Page

In order to access the settings page:

1. Log in to the ambassador website
2. Go to the back-end, administrative section of the website
3. Hover over "Settings" in the left side admin menu
4. Click "Ambassador Settings" menu item

## Edit Profile Page

This will be used for determining where the "Edit Profile" link on the Dashboard takes the user to. Select a page from the drop down.

## Ambassador Default Agent/Lender

Choose a default agent and a default lender from the list of users. When a user submits a request from their dashboard "Add New" hometohome, if they have not selected any network users, this user will be used.

## Ambassador Level Limits

These various inputs are used to limit the number of network agents/lenders a user can add to their profile. Fill out, with a number, the proper limits for each level. For example, if you fill out "5" in the "Gold Member Agents" field, then gold lenders will only be able to select up to 5 agents.

## Ambassador WishList Level Map

This is very important and should be setup immediately. This is what tells the Ambassador System how the various WLM (WishList Member) levels correlate to member levels (Platinum, Gold, Silver) and member types (Agent or Lender). From the supplied dropdowns, select the corresponding levels. For example, in the "Agent Levels" field, you will want to enter all WLM levels that correspond to the member being an agent.
